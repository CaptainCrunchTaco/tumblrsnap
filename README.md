==========

A fun photos app built on Tumblr. Used for our CodePath bootcamp.

**Note**: The main branch has certain key code removed specifically focused around interacting with the gallery and the camera. 
This is an intentional part of the assignment to fill this code back in to make the app work.

Note: Code has been implemented successfully and allows user to take a photo, or choose an existing photo and post it. 

Functionality is shown in this YouTube video: http://youtu.be/bbnEhJejZLI
